# Elevator

Lucid just moved to a brand new office building on 10355 South Jordan Gateway. On the first day, everyone arrives at exactly 9:00 AM. Unfortunately, only one elevator is working.

Each person needs to get from the ground floor to the floor where they work. (People working on ground floor don't need the elevator.) Assume the elevator takes 20 seconds to move between adjacent floors, and people don't take any extra time to get on or off.

Given that the elevator is limited on the number of people it can carry, when is the soonest that everyone can be on their desired floor?

# Input

The first line is the capacity of the elevator 0 < C <= 100 and the number of people 0 <= N <= 5000, separated by a space.
Each of the next N lines is the floor -100 <= F <= 100 that person needs to reach. The ground floor is zero.

# Output

The soonest time that everyone will be at their desk, given as hh:mm:ss XM.
