# Powerful Growth

Lucid Software is growing very quickly and needs to move to a new building. We want to choose a location that can hold all current employees and have plenty of room to spare for more rapid growth. You notice that Lucid's growth is exponential and decide that if the current population is `N`, the next power of two `M` such that `M > N`  should suffice. (You might be aware that this is how dynamic arrays are resized in some languages.)

## Input

A single integer `N < 2^20`.

## Output

The smallest power of two larger than `N`.
