# Powerful Growth

Lucid Software is growing very quickly and needs to move to a new building. We want to choose a location that can hold all current employees and have plenty of room to spare for more rapid growth.

Some dynamic array implementations increase size to the nearest power of two. Taking inspiration from that implementation, given the current employees, find the smallest power of two greater that that number.

## Input

A single integer 0 < N < 2^20.

## Output

The smallest power of two larger than N.

## Examples

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Input</th>
        <th>Input</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><pre>2
</pre></td>
        <td><pre>50</pre></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Output</th>
        <th>Output</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><pre>4</pre></td>
        <td><pre>64</pre></td>
    </tr>
</table>
